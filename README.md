# shellscript
A shell script created for a coursework assessment. The purpose of the script was to accurately create a specific directory structure with the following requirements:

1. The location of the start point (root) of the subtree created must be passed to the script as a parameter. If there are no parameters supplied then the script must terminate, giving the user a simple usage message.

2. The script must be correctly indented and must contain comments that at least include author name and date of creation.

3. If the specified start point already exists, then the script must terminate without creating the file structure.

4. If the specified start point does not exist, then the script must create the subtree, and create a small logfile ( called logfile.log ) in the root directory of the subtree. This file must contain the time/date of creation of the structure, and the login name of the user who ran the script to create the script.

5. The appropriate control structures must be selected and used correctly.

6. It is possible that the script will have to be amended from a location where there is no access to a graphical user interface editor - Detail of how to add a comment line to the end of the file using the standard Unix editor (vi)  must be included.

7. The script must be as portable across different versions of the operating system as possible.
